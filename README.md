Hey, I'm David 👋 I live in Kent in the UK, and I'm a Software Engineer.

I ♥ to write on my blog about all of the things I've learnt on my journey 🚶 as a Software Engineer, while also creating 🔨 apps & libraries, and contributing to open-source projects.

Check out some of my projects 💻:

- 📝 **[nimblenote](https://nimblenote.app)** - a simple keyboard-driven note taking app
- ✅ **[mygayvote.co.uk](https://mygayvote.co.uk)** - [open-source](https://github.com/davidwinter/mygayvote.co.uk) website with LGBT voting records for UK MPs
- 🔍 **[sensible_logging](https://github.com/davidwinter/sensible_logging)** - a logging library with sensible defaults for Sinatra apps
- 🔁 **[electron-auto-update](https://github.com/davidwinter/electron-auto-update)** - simple auto-updates for Electron apps
- 🐕 **[penny](https://github.com/davidwinter/penny)** - a minimalist hugo theme
